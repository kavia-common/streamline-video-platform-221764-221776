# Example environment variables for the streaming_database container
#
# Copy this file to ".env" and adjust values as needed for your environment.
# The backend and tooling can then read SQLITE_DB (and, in the future, POSTGRES_URL)
# without hard-coding connection details in code.

# Absolute path to the SQLite database file for the streaming app.
# This should normally match the path written to db_connection.txt and
# db_visualizer/sqlite.env by init_db.py.
SQLITE_DB=/absolute/path/to/streamline-video-platform-221764-221776/streaming_database/myapp.db

# Optional: PostgreSQL connection URL for future migration away from SQLite.
# When using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite, set this to your database URL and
# update the backend configuration to use it.
# POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/streaming_db
